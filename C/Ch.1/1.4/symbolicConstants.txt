A final observation before we leave temperature conversion forever. It's bad
practice to bury "magic numbers" like 300 and 20 in a program; they convey
little information to someone who might have to read the program later, and
they are hard to change In a systematic way. One way to deal with magic
numbers is to give them meaningful names. A #define line defines a symbolic 
name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters:

                     #define name replacement text

The quantities LOWER, UPPER and STEP are symbolic constants, not variables,
so they do not appear in declarations. Symbolic constant names are convention-
ally written in upper case so they can be readily distinguished from lower case
variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a #define
line.
