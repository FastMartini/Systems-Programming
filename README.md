# Systems-Programming

This repository showcases my journey in mastering the C programming language through hands-on practice and exercises inspired by the Second Edition of "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. It reflects my growing skills in systems-level programming, focusing on core concepts such as memory management, pointers, file I/O, and data structures in C.
